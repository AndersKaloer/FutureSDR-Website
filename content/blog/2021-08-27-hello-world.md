We are not perfect, but we are here :-) Yay! A lot of stuff is still very much
in the flow, but we think that the project reached a state, where it might be
interesting for some.

After a lot of refactoring, we believe that the main components are in place and
development is more fun, working on bugs and issues that are more local, i.e.,
one doesn't have to change bits across the whole code base to fix something :-)

FutureSDR implements several new concepts. We hope you have some fun
playing around with them. So happy hacking and please get in touch with us on GitHub or
Discord, if you have questions, comments, or feedback.
